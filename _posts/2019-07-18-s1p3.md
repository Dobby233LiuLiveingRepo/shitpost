<@zimkaim> What do you think
<@jimbo> Bad. But I have one that is very good, so it's not as bad to me, and it's still the same thing.
<@chi_wont> This doesn't really affect me since I'm not very smart, just like you.
<@zmf> What does?
<@zmf> That's why I said, "I'm not stupid."
<@jimbo> Yeah. Well, then, we might as well stop there before it gets boring.
<@chi_wont> I said, "You're very smart. Go on."
<@zuemoon> I didn't say, "go on." I just said, "go on."
<@ziemoon> I know what you meant, but I don't want to get into that again.
<@ze_jung> I think I'm going to tell him the truth, just for his sake.
<@ze_jung> If he does the same thing twice, he will learn.
<@ze_jung> I think it's the way it is when it's a kid. If it's just someone else, he's not smart. But if a person is smart, then we've made it.
<@chi_wont> Why?
<@jimbo> I thought it was a matter of time till somebody told me that's something that should be discussed, but not this time!
<@chi_wont> I'm sorry. I'm still not sure.
<@zwiec> I agree. You're right that it's more troublesome.
<@ze_jung> I'll tell him it is because I don't think anyone will believe him. But he should tell me if it's not true.
<@jimbo> So, then, we just have to let the person know.
<@zi_wont> It'll make the discussion more interesting.
<@ze_jung> If I have to tell him that, he'll be more likely to believe.
<@ze_jung> So, tell him about me.
<@ze_jung> This will make it easier.
<@zi_wont> This will keep it interesting.
<@ze_jung> I don't have an answer yet, but I will ask you, if I can give it.
