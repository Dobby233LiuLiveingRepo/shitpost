<@chara> well had to ask, is this real
<@Niko> Nobody knows.
<@chara> so someone can hop in randomly?
<@Niko> Yeah. This world is random, so everything might happen.
<@chara> wdym
<@Niko> Oh, like this one.
<@TweenYaew> *looking @Niko and @chara* Sorry, I'm visiting for a while.
<@chara> ok ok. *plain face* this world is weird, so be careful, you might get cold anytime
<@TweenYaew> That makes sense, because this world is a little dark and windy.
<@Niko> But why I can't feel wind...
<@chara> i don't know how to feel wind, just like you
<@chara> but why
<@Niko> I don't really know too.
<@chara> like, if you try to touch the world and see it is windy or dark...
<@chara> then you could get cold too
<@chara> like, the cold part is not that bad if you are cold
<@chara> but if you are not really cold you will get really cold or it will get cold
<@chara> like it is, the cold part is not too bad.
<@chara> but i cant feel wind when i'm cold
<@chara> it is a little worse when i'm warm
<@chara> like this.
<@chara> oh ok ok.. it is not windy or light at all, it is just windy.
<@chara> but if you touch it and feel it cold then it is windy
<@chara> and i can feel it
<@chara> like this
<@chara> I think this is true
<@Niko> The world is random, not some place that knows you can get cold, not some random place that knows you can get cold, but the world itself.
<@chara> i think I should go on there
<@Niko> @chara Yeah, it is random.
<@Niko> I think we are in some nonexist place.
<@chara> like?
<@Niko> This place is random, because in other worlds we can touch the land, we can touch the earth and it will get cold. But this world is not a place like that.
<@TweenYaew> I think so, it's messy.
<@chara> but what about the world?
<@chara> i really don't know how to feel wind or weather...
<@chara> it looks kind of weird to me.
<@TweenYaew> This is the weird part.
<@TweenYaew> Like.. the world looks like it was cut up
<@chara> and i feel like I am in the middle or something... But I don't understand.
<@chara> i feel like I am a random character, like I am in this random world where I touch land, like there is no wind in this random world, so i feel like im in the middle of this random world where this random thing is happening. I don't understand why. It looks very weird, and i can sense wind in the sky, and the wind in the sky seems like it moves like in the windy part...
<????????> Well, this world is randomly generated, so it can look messy and weird.
<@chara> but i don't understand i feel like i have my own world where this random thing is happening here, but it is not this random thing, it is just like me. like this
<@chara> the wind is really light, i can feel it in the air, like this.
<@chara> i can feel it in my eyes, my ears and like my nose. I know it is my own world, but this is not my world, it is a strange place
<@chara> but i can't explain anything so i just feel like this is the weirdest thing.
<@chara> i want to get out from this
<@Chara> i am very afraid of this, i really don't know what to do
<@chara> and i want to get out from this
<@chara> I feel like there is no wind at all, because if there is no wind then i cant feel it anymore
<@chara> and i can't feel the wind. but it keeps moving... It keep moving.
<@chara> and so can I, no matter how far away i go.
<@chara> like it is moving so fast
<@chara> like i cant hear what is that noise?
<@TweenYaew> It's different for me... I can feel time flies, and I can feel power.... I know its weird, so... It is very strange, but it makes me feel like I can have other worlds and worlds from this one, like a dream
<@chara> and that i am in this dream world
<@chara> is strange
<@chara> like i feel like im in my own world
<@chara> the world is strange
<@Chara> the world is very very strange, and im trying to understand it
