<@dobby233liu> iam shit in nutshel
<@Niko> No you're not! Believe yourself!
<@dobby233liu> okay. what to do?
<@Niko> I guess sit and messing with OneShot crossovers?
<@dobby233liu> and it's pretty easy to do too!
<@Niko> Not at all.
<@Niko> ...Well, it's easy in some point too. Putting a lightblub there, wait a second!
<@Niko> Oh, I can't.
<@Niko> I'm not going to use it anyway, while you will.
<@Niko> I don't know why I didn't do it sooner. But I need something for that.
<@Niko> It would be nice to make a lightblub.
<@Niko> I dunno?
<@Niko> I mean, I've always done it.
<@Niko> But now. It's kinda messy and kinda hard to put it on.
<@Niko> It'd help. I can get something, right?
<@Niko> Like the light, and the lightblub.
<@Niko> Oh, I'm going to get something.
<@Niko> Well then.
<@Niko> That means...one moment (shot).
Niko got a nasty controller...
<@dobby233liu> Why you take them there...
<@Niko> Y'know. The intro.
a strange person builds the remember scene.
<@Niko> Well, place it here...!
Niko is going to use a weird controller.
<@Niko> Oh!
<@Niko> ...Ah.
Niko got an electric guitar.
<@Niko> Oh, that's nice.
Niko got an electric piano.
<@Niko> Oh.
<@Niko> Aaaaa......
<@Niko> What do you mean?
<@Niko> I'll make some kind of music.
<@Niko> I'll use a strange instrument like the electric guitar and that will probably...be a bit too...
<@Niko> ...You know. Making weird music for the scene.
<@Niko> Okay. That's nice.
<@Niko> I'll make piano music.
<@Niko> I think...
<@Niko> I will write the piano music.
Niko got a guitar and a guitar with keys.
<@Niko> Oh, thatz amazing.
